## Function
When the user navigates to the index page, they will see the current date listed at the top of the page. Below they will see blocks for each hour of the work day (9-5). Past hours will have grey backrounds, current hour a red background, and future hours will be green. When the user clicks on an hour block, they can enter to-do text. If the user then clicks the hour's corresponding "save" button, that hour's to-do text will be saved to local storage. If not, the text will disappear when the page is refreshed.
